# Todo Web Application Assignment

## Objective
Develop a Todo Web Application where users can manage their daily tasks by storing them and updating their status. The application should support user authentication, task management, and profile management.

## Technologies

The following technologies are required for this project:

1. **ReactJS** (Frontend)
2. **Node.js**, **Express** (Backend API)
3. **JWT** for authentication
4. **UUID** for generating a unique ID
5. **SQLite3** or **MongoDB** for database management

## Functional Requirements

### 1. User Authentication:
- **Signup**: Implement a Signup feature where new users can register by providing the necessary details.
- **Login**: Implement a Login feature where registered users can authenticate themselves using JWT tokens.
